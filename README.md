# Edge Delivery Services with AEM Authoring Boilerplate for Commerce
This project boilerplate is for AEM Authoring with Edge Delivery Services (aka Crosswalk) projects that integrate with Adobe Commerce.

## Documentation

Before using the boilerplate, we recommend you to go through the documentation on https://experienceleague.adobe.com/developer/commerce/storefront/ and more specifically:

1. [Storefront Developer Tutorial](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/developer/commerce/storefront/get-started/)
1. [AEM Docs](https://www.aem.live/docs/)

## Environments
- Preview: https://main--{repo}--{owner}.aem.page/
- Live: https://main--{repo}--{owner}.aem.live/

## Pre-requisites

Out of the box, this project template uses a pre-configured Adobe Commerce environment. If you want to use your own Adobe Commerce environment, you'll need to update the `configuration` spreadsheet in your AEM site to have values that match your environment.

Additionally, you need to have the following modules and customizations installed on your environment:

1. adobe-commerce/storefront-compatibility: Contains changes to the Adobe Commerce GraphQL API that enable drop-ins functionality.
1. magento/module-data-services-graphql: Commerce module with the functionality necessary for adding context to events.
1. magento/module-page-builder-product-recommendations: Commerce module required for PRex Widget
1. magento/module-visual-product-recommendations: Commerce module required for PRex Widget
<!-- 1. TODO: Add further prereqs.  -->

## Installation

```sh
npm i 
```

## Updating Drop-in dependencies

You may need to update one of the drop-in components, or `@adobe/magento-storefront-event-collector` or `@adobe/magento-storefront-events-sdk` to a new version. Besides checking the release notes for any breaking changes, ensure you also execute the `postinstall` script so that the dependenices in your `scripts/__dropins__` directory are updated to the latest build. This should be run immediately after you update the component, for example:

```
npm install @dropins/storefront-cart@2.0. # Updates the storefront-cart dependency in node_modules/
npm run postinstall # Copies scripts from node_modules into scripts/__dropins__
```

This is a custom script which copies files out of `node_modules` and into a local directory which EDS can serve. You must manually run `postinstall` due to a design choice in `npm` which does not execute `postinstall` after you install a _specific_ package.

## Linting

```sh
npm run lint
```

## Setup

See also [Developer Tutorial](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/content/edge-delivery/wysiwyg-authoring/edge-dev-getting-started)

1. Create a new repository based on the `aem-boilerplate-xcom` template 
2. Install all dependencies using `npm i`.
3. Add the [AEM Code Sync GitHub App](https://github.com/apps/aem-code-sync) to the repository, so your code changes get synced with EDS.
4. Create a new site in AEM using the [site template](https://github.com/adobe-rnd/aem-boilerplate-xcom/releases) provided with the boilerplate release
5. Update the mountpoint in [`fstab.yaml`](https://github.com/adobe-rnd/aem-boilerplate-xcom/blob/main/fstab.yaml)
6. Update the path mappings in [`paths.json`](https://github.com/adobe-rnd/aem-boilerplate-xcom/blob/main/paths.json)
7. publish the pages to see them in action on aem.page or aem.live
8. To use you own Adobe Commerce SaaS configuration you must update it in the `configs` sheet in your AEM site.

## Notes
- some commerce blocks dont show the final output in UE but placeholders, e.g. account related blocks, enrichment. To see them in action you have to preview or publish the page.
- folder mapping is used on Edge Delivery to map virtual product pages to a an existing page template (/products/default). if you open the the template page in UE, to be able to see the pdp block, one product has been [hardcoded](https://github.com/adobe-rnd/aem-boilerplate-xcom/blob/main/scripts/editor-support.js#L15) for now.
- It is [recommended](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/developer/commerce/storefront/seo/metadata/) uploading product metadata into Edge Delivery Services so that it can be rendered server-side on product detail pages, see `/products/default/metadata` spreadheet. There is a tool that can help you create this data, see [here](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/developer/commerce/storefront/seo/metadata/#generate-metadata).
